Welcome to ScalablePrototyping Chip8 Interpreter, developed by:

* Álvaro Páez Guerra
* Juan José Blasco Burguillos

This project show cases the latest C++ cross-platform development best 
practices, making extensive use of C++17 features, the STL, and modern build, 
continuous integration and coverage tools. 

This Chip8 Interpreter allows to run chip8 ROMs and to interact with them. Example ROMs can be found 
[here](https://github.com/dmatlack/chip8/tree/master/roms).
